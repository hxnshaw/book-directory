# book-directory
Still in the process of developing myself,this project shows the CRUD operations in Nodejs.
It is connected to the Mongo DB database as well.
A user can create a book title and give the summary of his/her book. 
The user or author can upload a display picture as well. 
Authentication, password hashing and middlewares were all an important part of the project,and I learnt a great deal about them.
